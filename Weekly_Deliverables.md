**Week 1**: A detailed plan of action with the following:

    * An overview of the intended application and WHY you feel it's valuable.

			This is an application to help companies track inventory. Many companies lose money over the time spent tracking items between departments or items that have gone unaccounted for in the process of transferring. This application will help alleviate some of those errors and give the company better visibility on their products.

    * A breakdown of roles by group member.

			April - Authentication
			Kelly - Database & auth
			Ben - Smart Front End
			Chris - Dumb Front End


    * A schedule for completion of various tasks.

			Lots of schemeing

    * A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule.

			April is working on this

    * A set of DETAILED screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data relevant to the screen.

			Not done

      * On this note, show Slides 26-27 as an example of a UI/UX and Data Flow layout. Tell the class that you'll expect something akin to these drafts.

				No slides yet

  * **Week 2**: A functioning **minimal viable product** (i.e., a prototype version of your app that shows the intended function). This should be as close to a working app as possible and include:

    * A 5-7 minute presentation that discusses what your app is, what it does, and how it works. You will be presenting to instructors and TAs during class.

    * A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule. This should be updated to reflect remaining priorities and completed tasks.

  * **Week 3**: A significantly more polished version of the app.

    * This should literally seem like an app that you would submit.

    * Include a summary of significant issues faced to date and their resolution.

    * Provide a detailed description of each person's contributions.

    * Submit a detailed plan that describes remaining efforts. This should describe remaining issues like:
      * Stretch Features
      * Bugs
      * Enhancements
      * UI Polishing

  * **Week 4**: The Presentation!
    * A 7-10 minute demonstration of your app.
    * More on this as we near closer to the end.
